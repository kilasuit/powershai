# Remove-GradioSessionApi

## SYNOPSIS
Removes API calls from the internal session list.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-GradioSessionApi [[-Target] <Object>] [-Force] [-Elegible] [[-session] <Object>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet helps in the removal of events generated by Invoke-GradioSessionApi from the internal calls list. 
Typically, you want to remove events that you have already processed, passing the ID directly.
 
However, this cmdlet allows for various types of removals, including unprocessed events.
 
Use with caution, as once an event is removed from the list, the associated data is also removed.
 
Unless you have made a copy of the event (or the resulting data) to another variable, you will no longer be able to retrieve this information.
 

Removing events is also useful for helping to free up consumed memory, which, depending on the amount of events and data, can be high.
