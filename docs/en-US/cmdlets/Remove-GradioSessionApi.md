# Remove-GradioSessionApi

## SYNOPSIS <!--!= @#Synop !-->
Removes API calls from the session's internal list

## DESCRIPTION <!--!= @#Desc !-->
This cmdlet helps to remove events generated by Invoke-GradioSessionApi from the internal list of calls. 
Normally, you'll want to remove events that you've already processed, passing the direct id.  
However, this cmdlet allows several types of removal, including unprocessed events.  
Use with caution, because once an event is removed from the list, the data associated with it is also removed.  
Unless you've made a copy of the event (or the resulting data) to another variable, you'll no longer be able to retrieve this information.  

Removing events is also useful for helping to free up memory used, which, depending on the number of events and data, can be high.
