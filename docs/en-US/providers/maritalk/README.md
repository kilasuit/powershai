# Provider MARITALK

Maritalk is an LLM created by Brazilians.  
You can find more information at https://www.maritaca.ai/

They do not have a 100% compatible API with OpenAI, but I believe this will be resolved over time.  
Also, there is no support for the JSON response format.  

Therefore, the commands that work best are `Get-AiChat` and `ia`.  

# Initial configurations 

* Use Set-AiProvider maritalk
* Use Set-MaritalkToken to configure the token! (obtain it at https://plataforma.maritaca.ai/chaves-de-api)
